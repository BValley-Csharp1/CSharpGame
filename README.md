# Branches
 - master contain an aggregate of answers. At various points in time I merge Users/* into master.
 - Users/\<name\> contain answers for a specific user.
 - Users/\<name\>-\<topic\> contain topic branches for a specific user.
 - new-project is the branch I base new answers off from.
 
# Why?
 - It's fun.
 - It's educational.
 - It's an excellent coding kata.
 - It's an excellent git experiment (I am a git newbie).
 - I don't have a portfolio so I thought I could use this as a fallback.
